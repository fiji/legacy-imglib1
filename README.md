legacy-imglib1
==============

The legacy ImgLib 1 version for use by Fiji plugins until they switch to ImgLib2.

This library is deprecated and will not be developed further.  If you came here to develop a generic image processing algorithm in Java, please use ImgLib2 instead which is much more elegant, flexible, performant, and fun.
